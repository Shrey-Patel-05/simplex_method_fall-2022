Made in October- November 2022. My First Project

An implementation of Dantzig's simplex algorithm in C# with a Unity interface. Can be used to solve 1-stage and 2-stage problems.

It can be used here:
https://tatisjrisacheater.itch.io/simplex-method-software

Instructions:
1. Input the names of any variables in the problem using 'Add Variable'.
2. Go into 'Add Constraints'
3. On the left-hand side, you can add coefficients of each variable in teh objective function. press teh '+' to add the variable to teh objective function.
4. Once complete with the objective function press "done".
5. Now you can add the constraints of the problem in the same way. The main difference is you can modify the constant on the right-hand side of the inequality, as well as switch the direction of the inequality.
6. Once complete with the constraints, go back to the home screen and now you can click on "Solve" to see the optimal solution to your problem.
